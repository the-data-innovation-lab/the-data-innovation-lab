Established in July 2021, the Data Innovation Lab serves as an integrated environment for research in the area of innovation economics and management. We are particularly interested in understanding how we can leverage and comprehend the role of the data and AI revolution in shaping innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity at the individual, firm and societal level.

For instance, our prior work has shown the impact of satellite imagery on discovery and entrepreneurship in the gold mining industry, the impact of data-driven genomics on innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, and the impact of online review listings on business performance in the restaurant industry. Our research is typically conducted using large-scale observational data and applied microeconometric techniques, as well as applied machine learning tools, albeit complemented with in-depth phenomenological and qualitative work in the settings we study.

With chapters at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, we are a highly collaborative group. We host researchers at various stages of their careers, including pre-doctoral and post-doctoral scholars, PhD candidates, and undergraduate/masterâ€™s students.
